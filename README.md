## Main Process

In the land surface process model, the exchange and allocation of water is crucial, which involves the balance of energy and water, and has an important impact on the soil layers. This process plays a key role in simulating characteristics such as permafrost and underground ice, as well as ecological processes such as vegetation growth and transpiration.Noah-MP is described by the Richards equation for soil water movement, and its formula is as follows:
